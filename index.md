## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, you need to include the Allegro REST API Client in your Java project. You can do this using Maven or Gradle.

#### Maven

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>allegro-rest-api-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

Add the following line to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'com.example:allegro-rest-api-client:1.0.0'
```

### Configuration

Before using the client, you need to configure it with your Allegro API credentials. You can do this by creating a configuration file or setting environment variables.

#### Example Configuration

```java
AllegroApiClient client = new AllegroApiClient("your-client-id", "your-client-secret");
```

## Usage

### Basic Operations

The Allegro REST API Client supports various operations. Below are examples of how to perform basic tasks.

#### Fetching Items

To fetch items from the Allegro marketplace, use the following method:

```java
List<Item> items = client.getItems();
for (Item item : items) {
    System.out.println(item.getName());
}
```

#### Creating a New Listing

To create a new item listing, use the following code:

```java
Item newItem = new Item("Item Name", "Item Description", 100.00);
client.createItem(newItem);
```

### Error Handling

The client provides error handling features to manage issues effectively. If an error occurs, you can catch it as follows:

```java
try {
    client.getItems();
} catch (ApiException e) {
    System.err.println("Error fetching items: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
